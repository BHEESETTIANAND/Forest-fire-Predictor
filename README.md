# ðŸ”¥Forest-fire-PredictorðŸ”¥

In this project i have built a predictive model which can be used to predict whether there is chance of getting ðŸ”¥Forest fireðŸ”¥ or not.
This project is done based on the Algerian forest fire dataset.
As it is a classification problen i have used Supervised ML algorithms like Logistic Regression,Decision trees,Support vector machines,
Random forest classifier to build the ML model.
In all the above models i have gotten 100% accuracy in Random Forest Model.and 97% accuracy in the Logistic Regression.
An i haved deployed this model using Streamlit.
